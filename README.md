# CS5100 Final Project 👩🏽‍🔬🧑🏾‍💼📊📈✅

Topics: Everything

For this assignment you will:

* Demonstrate your mastery of machine learning on a dataset of your choosing.
* You will then try to learn something from your data. What you learn is up to you but it should have some utility.
* You will need to use multiple learning methods and compare to each other.
* Then you will need to tune and validate your model.
* Finally, visualize something from your data (how/what is up to you).

## Data Requirements

The data you choose must:

* Be recently posted this year, although it can be data for last year that was just published this year.
* Must have at least 500 records.
* Come from a reputable source.
* It cannot be the same as another student in this class.

Once you pick a data source and problem you will need to post on Piazza to:

1. Identify the data source
   The data source is from the fMRI project BOLD5000, a large scale human functional MRI study that includes over 5000 images paired with fMRI imaging data from subjects shown these photos. The original paper and dataset were published in 2019 but the second release came out in 2021.
2. What you wish to learn from the data
   * The main focus of my final project will be to utilize the fMRI voxel ROI data from the over 5000 records and perform exploratory analysis, specifically using unsupervised learning with K-clustering. The data will go through feature selection to reduce the number of variables for each record from 180 to less than 20 before being put through different clustering algorithms. With results from the clusters, the images shown to human subjects associated with the fMRI will be cross-referenced and labelled and compared against the actual labels of the images. 
   * Stretch: images will be fed into the CORnet model, a neural net model based on human brain mechanisms, to produce object recognition results and compared against image labels produced from this project.
3. How you want to visualize it.
   * Visualize fMRI voxel data points through clustering
   * Visualize images that produced similar responses from the brain using their given labels and wordcloud

The teaching team will provide feedback. The data sets are on a first-come-first-serve basis. You are encouraged to start early.

## Jupyter

You will complete the included Jupyter Notebook and provide nessessary and sufficient documentation so that the teaching team can have a full understanding of your project and run you code without errors. Be sure to also answer the reflection questions at the end of the notebook.

## Presentation

You will present your work to the class in 3-5 minute lecture with slides. Add your presentation slides to this repository in .pdf or .pptx format only.
